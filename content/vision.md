    content: "**\" To bring like-minded people together and just watch them create magic \"**\r\n\nWhen two or more people with similar interests and goals come together, they create something\r\n\nsubstantial. A research scholar is looking for other researchers who can further contribute to his\r\n\nobservations. A music band is looking for a great artist. NGO's are in search of dedicated volunteers.\r\n\nA founder of a start-up is in need of a co-founder. A young boy is looking for a suitable girl to marry\r\n\nher. People are always in need of their kind of people.\r\n\nWe wish to bridge this gap and provide a platform where people can find others like them. Moving\r\n\non, let us now try to understand how the app will work.\r\n\nThe homepage would let users choose their areas of interest. Once they've done that, they would\r\n\nprovide detailed information about their interests and work. They would also mention if they are\r\n\nlooking for individuals with specific qualities or skill set. Once, they are done with the sign-up, they\r\n\nwould receive recommendations and suggestions based on the information they've provided. And if\r\n\nthey have a close match for their set preferences, they can ping the person they are interested in. If\r\n\nthe individual at the other end is also interested, he/she can ping back and they can start\r\n\ncommunicating."
