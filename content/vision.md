      **" To bring like-minded people together and just watch them create magic
      "**


      When two or more people with similar interests and goals come together,
      they create something substantial. A research scholar is looking for other
      researchers who can further contribute to his observations. A music band
      is looking for a great artist. NGO's are in search of dedicated
      volunteers. A founder of a start-up is in need of a co-founder. A young
      boy is looking for a suitable girl to marry her. People are always in need
      of their kind of people.


      We wish to bridge this gap and provide a platform where people can find
      others like them. Moving on, let us now try to understand how the app will
      work.


      The homepage would let users choose their areas of interest. Once they've
      done that, they would provide detailed information about their interests
      and work. They would also mention if they are looking for individuals with
      specific qualities or skill set. Once, they are done with the sign-up,
      they would receive recommendations and suggestions based on the
      information they've provided. And if they have a close match for their set
      preferences, they can ping the person they are interested in. If the
      individual at the other end is also interested, he/she can ping back and
      they can start communicating.
