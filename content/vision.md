      **" To bring like-minded people together and just watch them create magic
      "**


      When two or more people with similar interests and goals come together,
      they create somethingsubstantial. A research scholar is looking for other
      researchers who can further contribute to hisobservations. A music band is
      looking for a great artist. NGO's are in search of dedicated volunteers.A
      founder of a start-up is in need of a co-founder. A young boy is looking
      for a suitable girl to marryher. People are always in need of their kind
      of people.


      We wish to bridge this gap and provide a platform where people can find
      others like them. Moving on, let us now try to understand how the app will
      work.


      The homepage would let users choose their areas of interest. Once they've
      done that, they wouldprovide detailed information about their interests
      and work. They would also mention if they arelooking for individuals with
      specific qualities or skill set. Once, they are done with the sign-up,
      theywould receive recommendations and suggestions based on the information
      they've provided. And ifthey have a close match for their set preferences,
      they can ping the person they are interested in. Ifthe individual at the
      other end is also interested, he/she can ping back and they can
      startcommunicating.
