So, we are assuming that we have hired 2 professional developers who will be developing\r the app with us. The company has opted for a moderate\r server plan. We have rented a small place. We aim to publish\r the app by the end of the year. Evening snacks and drinks are\r also on the company. \r\n\nTherefore, the main expenditures for the company would be\r Salary, Server Cost, Rent, Snacks and some other\r Miscellaneous costs. The table shows the approximate\r costs per month for all the overheads. Summing them up for\r an year results to C$ 139,680."
