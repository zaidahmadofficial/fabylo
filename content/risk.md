      Our venture comes in the tech category and hence the major
       risks for us would be the following :

      **1) Technology Risk :** In today's world, technology is the
       driving factor for most companies and it keeps on changing
       quickly. What is new today, will not be new after 6 months or
       an year and thus using the right kind of technology is always a
       challenge for entrepreneurs.
       For me personally, it was tough to choose between the NATIVE
       and CROSS PLATFORM development. Native applications are
       powerful but require more time and money whereas hybrid
       apps take lesser time and money to build but you have to 
      compromise on certain features. After doing a thorough
       research and considering the future prospects, I finally went
       ahead with the cross platform development.

      **2) Market Risk :** Once the app is in the market and starts
       competing with other players, market risk comes in picture.
       The biggest question for all the entrepreneurs is " Will there
       still be a market after 1 or 2 years ? "
       For my venture, I keep thinking about a lot of things " Whether
       there is still space for a new social media app in the market ?
       Would I be able to create my own niche and retain customers ?
       Who would be my target audience ? .......
       I still don't have the answers yet but I am pretty confident, if
       the concept is implemented strategically, we can definitely
       create a small space for ourselves in the market.

      **3) Financial Risk** : Finance is the most important aspect of any
       venture. In the end everybody is working for a capital gain.
       Moreover in new start-ups, raising enough money is a big
       challenge. And once you've done that, making sure that the
       stakeholders don't lose their money is the next biggest
       concern.

      **4) Team Risk :** To make money, you need to create value. And
       to do that you need to find the right people. People who
       believe in the same vision as you do. People who are
       trustworthy. People who are dedicated and hardworking. Failing to find the right people can be a big potential risk to
       the company.

      **5) Legal Risk :** This is not considered a major risk but if it is
       not given due importance, it may have huge implications.
       Legal risks are basically uncertainties which may arise due to
       government regulations and other legal procedures.
       A good example is the banning of TikTok app by the
       government of India. The company lost over 2 MILLION
       customers in a short span of time as a consequence.
