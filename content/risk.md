    content: "My venture comes in the tech category and hence the major\r risks for us would be the following :\r\n\n**1) Technology Risk :** In today's world, technology is the\r driving factor for most companies and it keeps on changing\r quickly. What is new today, will not be new after 6 months or\r an year and thus using the right kind of technology is always a\r challenge for entrepreneurs.\r For me personally, it was tough to choose between the NATIVE\r and CROSS PLATFORM development. Native applications are\r powerful but require more time and money whereas hybrid\r apps take lesser time and money to build but you have to \rcompromise on certain features. After doing a thorough\r research and considering the future prospects, I finally went\r ahead with the cross platform development.\r\n\n**2) Market Risk :** Once the app is in the market and starts\r competing with other players, market risk comes in picture.\r The biggest question for all the entrepreneurs is \" Will there\r still be a market after 1 or 2 years ? \"\r For my venture, I keep thinking about a lot of things \" Whether\r there is still space for a new social media app in the market ?\r Would I be able to create my own niche and retain customers ?\r Who would be my target audience ? .......\r I still don't have the answers yet but I am pretty confident, if\r the concept is implemented strategically, we can definitely\r create a small space for ourselves in the market.\r\n\n**3) Financial Risk** : Finance is the most important aspect of any\r venture. In the end everybody is working for a capital gain.\r Moreover in new start-ups, raising enough money is a big\r challenge. And once you've done that, making sure that the\r stakeholders don't lose their money is the next biggest\r concern.\r\n\n**4) Team Risk :** To make money, you need to create value. And\r to do that you need to find the right people. People who\r believe in the same vision as you do. People who are\r trustworthy. People who are dedicated and hardworking. Failing to find the right people can be a big potential risk to\r the company.\r\n\n**5) Legal Risk :** This is not considered a major risk but if it is\r not given due importance, it may have huge implications.\r Legal risks are basically uncertainties which may arise due to\r government regulations and other legal procedures.\r A good example is the banning of TikTok app by the\r government of India. The company lost over 2 MILLION\r customers in a short span of time as a consequence."
